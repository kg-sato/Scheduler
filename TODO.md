- [ ] Visually inspect desktop and mobile layouts when browser access is available.
- [ ] Refine assignment, rhythm and focus layouts with real content, long titles and empty states.
- [ ] Preserve neutral readable text, visible focus, reduced-motion and solid-material preferences.

## 2. TypeScript foundation

- [ ] Configure a backend and implement account identity, sync, conflict recovery and account deletion.
- [ ] Add WidgetKit only after shared data/signing decisions are made.
- [ ] Add course archive/rename and semester onboarding without losing event/task relationships.
- [ ] Consolidate accumulated CSS layers after visual direction approval.

## Handoff

October 6 handoff: the user requested completion of the current work and a short commit message. This implementation pass is finished locally; all changes remain uncommitted for review. No automatic continuation is scheduled. The release work above remains outstanding.

Checked items mean implemented in code, not release-tested. TypeScript compilation succeeded and HTML was formatted. No automated tests, native builds, calendar round trips, offline installation tests or SQL migrations were run. The in-app browser became available and was used for visual inspection with fictional preview data; the earlier Firefox limitation was not bypassed.

Read `docs/STUDY-FEATURES.md`, `docs/WEB-APP.md` and `design/RESEARCH-OCT05.md` before continuing. The root Application.html is the UI source of truth; `npm run build:core` embeds TypeScript and refreshes native/preview copies. The preview server runs locally on port 8002 while its process remains open.

## October 7 observatory overhaul

- [x] Rebuild sidebar and top bar with a floating glass shell and clear action hierarchy.
- [x] Add original shaded orbital background artwork, bounded parallax and finite transitions.
- [x] Simplify headings, assignment summaries, typography and secondary controls.
- [x] Add a contextual focus-session return indicator without changing timer persistence.
- [x] Improve tablet/phone layouts and retain solid, calm and higher-contrast variants.
- [x] Explain active device accessibility preferences in appearance settings.
- [x] Regenerate native/fictional preview copies and offline shell fingerprint.
- [x] Perform local visual review with fictional data; fix overflow and indicator positioning.
- [ ] Review on real iPhone/Safari and Firefox, including keyboard, screen reader and performance.
- [ ] Consolidate historical CSS layers after visual direction approval.

See `design/RESEARCH-OCT07.md` for source decisions, inaccessible references and review limits. Today's work is local and uncommitted; no push or deployment was performed.

October 8 closeout: remaining preference copy and focus-beacon keyboard handoff completed. UI pass finished locally; changes remain uncommitted for user review.

## October 9 dimensional UI pass

- [x] Strengthen card, calendar-selection, sidebar and button elevation without adding UI copy.
- [x] Explore a WebGL orbital scene; superseded after user feedback by the folded-light direction below.
- [x] Replace floating background objects with original full-viewport mint, lilac and pearl vector relief.

- [x] Adapt the composition to phone screens and retain quiet, solid, reduced-motion and higher-contrast appearances.
- [x] Regenerate app copies and document current implementation in `design/FOLDED-LIGHT.md`.
- [ ] Review physical iPhone/Safari and Firefox appearance and performance before release.

Changes remain local for review; no commit or push was performed.
